Worldmap Generation:
  -Convert lakes to ocean when they're ocean-adjacent
    -We do this, but it's buggy...

Graphics:
  -SDL integration with cuss stuff
  -Tiles, what do they look like

Command line:
  -Add runtime options:
    --data-set=<NAME>
      Sets the data set used.  Must be the name of a directory inside the data
      directory.  If blank, then the data set may be selected when creating a
      new world.
      Default: ""
    --profile-dir=<PATH>
      Sets the location of the top-level profile directory.  The profile
      directory may contain sever subdirectories, each of which stores options,
      save directories, character types, and other files.
      Default: "./Profiles"
    --profile=<NAME>
      Sets the name of the profile to use.  Must match the name of a directory
      inside the profile directory.
      Default: "Global" (?)
    --character=<NAME>
      Sets the name of the character to use.  If a save file exists in the
      profile directory in use, then the character will automatically be loaded.
      If blank, you'll be given a list of save files to choose from, or will be
      prompted for a name when creating a character.
      Default: ""

Data (general):
  -All data types (anything that goes into a Data_pool) needs a error_check()
   function.  Several types contain a string that's supposed to point to data.
   For instance, Terrain holds a string that's the name of the terrain it turns
   into when destroyed/opened/closed/etc.  Fields may hold a string that's the
   name of a field it produces when it consumes fuel.  Most of the time, we can
   check the validity of a data file as we read it, but in these cases, we're
   referencing data that may not have been loaded yet, so we need to check it
   after everything's been loaded.
   The function should be crafted specifically for each class that needs it, and
   should check anything that needs verification and throw a debugmsg if it's an
   issue.  The function should return true if everything's OK, false otherwise.
   Most functions will just be error_check() { return true; }
  -The function could also replace the string with a pointer to the data, since
   string lookup is a slow function, especially compared to a pointer deref.

Monsters:

Items:
  -Items currently all generate with an HP of 100, and it's only used when
   interacting with fields.
    -Allow the .dat file to specify HP?
     Or base HP off of volume?
    -Make hitting someone with an item knock off some HP (like, 1)
    -Make an item break if HP reaches 0

  -Item types from C1 that aren't in C2 yet:
    -Gun modifications
    -Books
    -CBMs
    -Software??
    -Artifacts????

AI and Pathing:
  -Add a Pathing_feature, "cover" - prefer to path through tiles which are
   opaque!
    Or maybe it's better to path *next to* tiles which are opaque?
    Can we / should we try to path so that opaque tiles are between us and our
    target?  Or is that too crazy?
      We can do this by adding a check to Map::get_movement_map():
        if (!senses(target, origin, 10, SENSE_SIGHT)) {
          cost -= 25;
        }

Status effects:
  Need to add these to:
    -Melee attacks
    -Ranged attacks
    -Fields

Messages:
  Set up a Game::add_canned_msg(std::string identifier) function.  This function
  should look at a table of canned messages, like "You don't have that item." or
  "Never mind." and print the result.  The table can be loaded from data,
  improving localization.

Combat:
  Allow cycling through ranged combat targets with > and <
    Obviously entities are valid "targets" for these purposes... anything else?
    Maybe gas pumps, etc?

Traits:
  Sturdy Constitution
  Robust Genetics
  Chemical Imbalance
  Bad Hearing
