Shops to add!

Hey content designers - feel free to tackle this list!  First, edit
data/world_terrain.dat.  At the end of the file, add an entry like this:

Name: hardware store
  Glyph: o ltblue black
  Road_cost: 500
  Flags: shop face_road
Done

The Name should match the name in this file.
The Glyph should probably be an o, but others are fine too.  It needs two
  colors, a foreground and a background, but the background should always be
  black!
The Road_cost should stay 500 for all shops.  It doesn't actually matter now,
  but it might in the future.
The Flag "shop" means it's a shop and will be placed in cities.  Use it!  The
  Flag "face_road" means it'll be rotated so that the north edge of the map will
  face a road.  If more than one road is available, it'll randomly pick one!

If you implement one of these, please mark it with "!"
